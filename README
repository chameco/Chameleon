HOW TO USE
------------
There are three major components to this library:

1) Events:
-Events are a very simple concept. They represent the binding between
a name (what is happening), and some data (what are the details of what is happening).
In the Python build, the name is a string, and data is any object, in the C++
build, both name and data are strings. An event is initialized using the constructor,
which takes the name and data as arguments. In Python, these two fields can later
be accessed as read-only properties, while in C++ they can be obtained using getName()
and getData().
