Description: Chameleon is a C++ and Python library that takes the concept of event-based coding to a
        whole new level. Each event that is raised can be handled by multiple listener classes,
        allowing for things such as asynchronous network servers to be implemented with ease, and 
        letting you add new listeners to your existing codebase without touching your old code. This
        comes in handy when writing scalable servers, games with plugins, etc. In addition, there is no
        main loop (you're responsible for raising all of the events), so it can be integrated with
        existing systems like Twisted, GLUT, GTK+, and Qt.
